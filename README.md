## Idea Explanations
Our app is a comprehensive solution for patients, offering a range of essential features. Patients can instantly check the availability of their **preferred doctor** upon entering the hospital and effortlessly book appointments using **AI**, eliminating long wait times. When in the range of the **hospital's beacon**, patients can also access a real-time waiting list for medicines, streamlining the process of obtaining medications. The app includes **hospital navigation, real-time doctor schedules, medication availability checks, a hospital holiday list, a staff directory, and information on government healthcare schemes**. This **all-in-one** app ensures a smooth and efficient healthcare experience for patients and promotes better communication and service within the hospital.

## Describe Use Cases here
When a patient is within the **beacon's** range, the system can instantly verify the doctor's current availability at the hospital and facilitate appointment booking. Both the patient and the doctor can access a **real-time waiting/appointment** list. Additionally, the hospital's pharmacy department can leverage this technology to provide **token numbers** or waiting numbers to patients seeking medication. Furthermore, an additional feature can be implemented to display the **navigation route** to the appointed rooms or departments within the hospital, enhancing the overall **experience** for patients and visitors.

## Dependencies / Show stopper here
1. **Hospital Infrastructure**: Reliable IT infrastructure and beacon technology are needed as app relies on it.
2. **Data Integration**: Seamless integration with hospital systems for real-time data.
3. **Security and Privacy**: Security breaches or data privacy issues could be a significant show stopper. Ensuring robust security measures and compliance with healthcare data regulations is vital.
4. **User Adoption**: If patients and hospital staff do not adopt the app, it may not realize its potential.
5. **Data Accuracy**: Inaccurate data regarding any information can lead to dissatisfaction and confusion among users.
6. **Pharmacy Integration**: Seamless coordination with the hospital's pharmacy for medication orders and pick-up is crucial.
